# MyPortfolio

Welcome to MyPortfolio, a personal portfolio project that showcases my work and skills. This project is built using React for the frontend and Sanity for the backend.

## Project Overview

MyPortfolio is a dynamic and responsive web application designed to showcase my projects, skills, and experiences. It serves as a platform for potential employers, collaborators, or anyone interested in my work to get a glimpse of my capabilities.

## Frontend
The frontend of MyPortfolio is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's component-based architecture allows for efficient code reuse and better manageability. It also provides a seamless user experience with its fast rendering capabilities.

## Backend
The backend of MyPortfolio is powered by Sanity, a platform for structured content that comes with an open-source editing environment. Sanity allows for real-time updates and collaboration, making it easier to manage and update the content displayed on the portfolio.
